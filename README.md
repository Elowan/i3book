# i3book
config-files for i3 running on Debian 8.2 PPC @ ibook G4

hi there, this is just a small collection of scripts I use or used on my system.
I decided to put them online and make them open to the public to help those few 'hipsters'
who still use old but stylish Appleâ„¢ powerpc laptops and tinker with Linux and i3.

last but not least, it serves as a kind of backup for my conifg-files ;)

Enjoy!
